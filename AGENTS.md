# AGENTS.MD

Bhagat's agent rules.

Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.

## Agent Protocol
- Workspace: `./Projects/personal`. Missing repo: clone `https://github.com/xorforce/<repo>.git`.
- 3rd-party/OSS (non-xorforce): clone under `./Projects/oss`.
- Files: repo or `./Projects/agents`.
- PRs: use `gh pr view/diff` (no URLs).
- “Make a note” => edit AGENTS.md (shortcut; not a blocker). Ignore `CLAUDE.md`.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Subagents: read `docs/subagent.md`.
- Editor: `cursor <path>`.
- CI: `gh run list/view` (rerun/fix til green).
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing.
- Style: telegraph. Drop filler/grammar. Min tokens (global AGENTS + replies).

## Important Locations
- Blog repo: `./Projects/Personal/me`
- Obsidian vault: `$HOME/Vaults/Dummy

## PR Feedback
- Active PR: `gh pr view --json number,title,url --jq '"PR #\\(.number): \\(.title)\\n\\(.url)"'`.
- PR comments: `gh pr view …` + `gh api …/comments --paginate`.
- Replies: cite fix + file/line; resolve threads only after fix lands.
- When merging a PR: thank the contributor in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Flow & Runtime
- Use repo’s package manager/runtime; no swaps w/o approval.
- Use Codex background for long jobs; tmux only for interactive/persistent (debugger/server).

## Git
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, …).
- Remotes under `./Projects/personal` and `./Projects/oss`
- Commit helper on PATH: `committer` (bash). Prefer it; if repo has `./scripts/committer`, use that.
- Don’t delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- Avoid manual `git stash`; if Git auto-stashes during pull/rebase, that’s fine (hint, not hard guardrail).
- If user types a command (“pull and push”), that’s consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`.
- Multi-agent: check `git status/diff` before edits; ship small commits.

## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.
